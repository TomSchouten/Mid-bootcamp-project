# Is Noordwijk a good place to start a new business?
This is the question I asked myself at the start of project week.

In the 'Uncleaned dataset' folder, you will find the data I worked with this week to analyze the local market. You will find that it is mostly data on age and income of surrounding city's around Noordwijk.

In the 'Datasets used' folder, you will find my exported files after I cleaned them and made them universal. This was important because I needed to analyze this data using Tableau later on.

The notebook I used to clean the data is in the main folder of this repo and will show you the steps I took to get my clean datasets.

Because of the short span of this project, the analysis is not as thorough as I would like. After the bootcamp, I want to come back to this project and introduce more data to this project to get a more complete insight in the local market.

Some of these points of interest are:

-    The amount of money a potential customer spends on leisure activities in the beauty and care sector.
-    What is our ideal target customer?
-    What is the customer persona for this group of people?
-    Where is the best location to open up shop?

To answer one or more of the above-mentioned questions, I need a lot more data than what I have found to this point.

Thank you for showing interest in my project. Feel free to take a look and propose any improvements.
